Hello!

Thanks for trying out this little utility I wrote. 
This is for people struggling with their "Fixture Data" output ending up miles off the grid in Capture. 

This is because Capture works in Meters by default and (in the UK) we work in mm. 
If your VWX document does not use mm, this will produce some hilariously wrong results. 
If anyone really likes working in inches or barleycorns or whatever, let me know and I'll put a menu with some options in place. 

Of course you can work around this by temporarily setting VWX to use Meters as the default unit, but that doesn't 
leave much of a challenge for me to program a little work around does it?

This is currently a windows based operation, but none of the code is Windows specific so it should compile fine on mac if anyone cares to try. 

Instructions: 
  1. Export your "Instrument Data" file from vwx, you must export X Location, Y Location & Z Location, then as many other fields as you need. 
    do not use "Export in Lightwright 4" format. 
  
  2. Open Vectorworks-Capture.exe, input the file path and file name, you can copy this from a right click > properties > location
  
  3. Hit return to run the conversion, you should see some output or a message that the file failed to read. If the file failed to read it's
  probably an issue with the file path. 
  
  4. Following a successful conversion, hit any key to quit. You'll find your converted file (labelled as such) in the same folder as the original file. 
  
  5. Import to capture the usual way! :-)
